Author: Matthew Vu
Date: 4/15/2020
Version: 1.0.2

Description:

This program manages a database storing information for all the members of the Centennial
FBLA chapter. This information includes the name, grade, email, student id, total service hours,
service award category, profile picture, and authorization level (member, admin, or advisor).
Users can create members, update values, and delete members. The program also sends out weekly service
reports for each individual member and the advisor. In addition, the program emails the chapter advisor
each day with a text document containing notes about changes to the database from user interaction.
Users interact with the program by logging in with their email and password. Users can send themselves
a recovery email if they forget their password.

Update Notes: minor text and style changes

Bugs: none so far
